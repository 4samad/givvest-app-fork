## Requirements

  

Before you begin, you need to install the following tools:

  

- [Node (>= v18.17)](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

- Yarn ([v1](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/) or [v2+](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install))

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

  

## Quickstart

  

To get started with Givvest, follow these steps:

  

1. Install dependencies if it was skipped in CLI:

```sh

cd my-dapp-example

yarn install

```

2. Run a local network in the first terminal:

```sh

yarn chain

```

This command starts a local Ethereum network using Hardhat. Customize the network configuration in `packages/hardhat/hardhat.config.ts`.

  

3. On a second terminal, deploy the test contract:

```sh

yarn deploy

```

This deploys a test smart contract to the local network. Modify the contract in `packages/hardhat/contracts` and the deploy script in `packages/hardhat/deploy`.

  

4. On a third terminal, start your NextJS app:

```sh

yarn start

```

Visit your app at: `http://localhost:3000`. Interact with your smart contract using the `Debug Contracts` page. Tweak the app config in `packages/nextjs/scaffold.config.ts`.

  

Run smart contract tests with `yarn hardhat:test`.

  

- Edit your smart contracts in `packages/hardhat/contracts`.

- Edit your frontend homepage at `packages/nextjs/app/page.tsx`. For routing and configuring pages/layouts, check out the Next.js documentation.

- Edit your deployment scripts in `packages/hardhat/deploy`.
